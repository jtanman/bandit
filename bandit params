k - number of arms (int)
bandit - which algorithm to use (Naive, Bayesian, Epsilon Greedy) - object of class Bandit
    - Naive requires params to be set

    - also the prior distribution is default but can be set
arm_names=None - k length list of names
start_date=None
run_date=None
data=None - if there's any prior data to include, list of pandas series of length k
sliding_window=None - parameter to decide what data to include, data past sliding window is thrown out (int)
